# Introduction

Welcome to my Data Visualization Portfolio! This repository serves as a central hub for showcasing various data visualization projects I have developed using Power BI/Tableau. Each project is stored in a separate repository and this README provides an overview along with links to explore them in detail.

# Projects

### 1. **[Onyx Data February 2025 Challenge](https://github.com/fahmiess/Project-Onyx-Data-February-2025-Challenge.git)**

- I participated in the Onyx Data February 2025 Challenge which focused on analyzing South American demographic and urbanization trends. The goal was to provide insights that support effective urban planning and sustainable growth.

- Using Power BI, I performed a detailed analysis of the dataset, visualizing key trends in population growth and urbanization. The insights generated can help policymakers and city planners in making informed decisions regarding infrastructure, resource allocation, and sustainability initiatives.
